## Future Project Plan üîÆ

Testing how good the Movie Recommender is :

1. Enhanced Recommendation Algorithm: Use machine learning to personalize movie suggestions based on user ratings and feedback, improving accuracy over time.
2. User Community Features: Add social elements like reviews, comments, and recommendations based on what friends or community members are watching.
3. Integration with External APIs: Connect with movie databases like IMDb or TMDb to get real-time movie details, ratings, and trending films for a better user experience.
4. Watchlist Feature: Allow users to create a personalized watchlist by saving movies they are interested in.


Note: Our system can be virtually tested through Github Actions inbuilt feature of build and test queries using python.

Make sure you taste your own medicine first and take into account other peoples familiarity with the system before you design your tests.

## Working üì±

Below working displays the system also evaluates movie attributes such as genre, cast, director, and user-generated reviews. 
- By combining these user-specific data and film characteristics, the recommender system employs machine learning to generate tailored movie recommendations.
- This enables users to discover new films that align with their individual tastes, making the movie-watching experience more enjoyable and engaging.
- The users can directly watch the trailer of any movie recommended to them. 
- Furthermore, recommender systems often employ a feedback loop, where users' interactions and feedback help refine the recommendations over time, ensuring that the suggestions remain relevant.
- The users can register and log in to their accounts to keep a history of the movies recommended for them.


## New Features
1. Register Page: Enhanced with password validation, ensuring it includes characters, numbers, and special characters.
2. Loading Spinner: Implemented a loading spinner between the predict and recommendation process for a smoother user experience.
3. Star-Based Rating System: Added a 5-star rating system for users to rate movies they‚Äôve already watched.
4. Feedback Functionality: Enabled feedback options only when users select an option, ensuring interaction is required.
5. History Feature: The history page now displays only the movies for which users provided feedback.
6. Watchlist Feature: Allow users to create a personalized watchlist by saving movies they are interested in.
